# Stock-Investment-Optimization-with-C++

This program uses the minimum variances theory to calculate a vector of ratios for stock investment.

In this project we will find the minimum variance portfolio, the most challenging part of this project was writing the linear algebra functions. This project requires basic knowledge in financial mathematics. A minimum variance portfolio is essentially the combination of securities that will minimuze the overall volatility of the portfolio. 

The matrix.h file contains varoious matrix operations including inverse and covariance, the functions are written with vectors.

The DataExtraction file contians functions that wll be used in order to turn the data from quandl into something we can use.

The main.cpp file is our main file it will find the minimum variance portfolio through some linear algebra.
